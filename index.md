## Profile
Starting with my first research project of ab initio genome annotation, I explored some fields in bioinformatics, computational protein design, and working on applying modern machine learning methods and traditional molecular dynamics or tackling problems in enzyme catalysis for better understanding and more efficient design and discovery. I am familiar with common databases like BRENDA, NCBI, Pfam, etc., and software like AutoDock Vina, Rosetta, FoldX, etc. I am used to working in Linux with python scripting. I also had experience in training deep learning models with PyTorch.
